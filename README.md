# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds and compares multiple machine learning models to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using diagnostic features.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (RBF)
- Random Forest

## Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Scaling
3. Model Training & Comparison
4. Cross-Validation
5. Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

## Results
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance due to its ability to capture non-linear feature interactions and handle correlated features effectively.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
